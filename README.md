## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/eloge.git .eloge
```

This creates a new hidden folder named **.eloge** in your home directory.

Copy the eloge.sh file from the new .eloge folder to you download folder.

Navigate to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x eloge.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./eloge.sh
```

## Update local repository

Change to ~/.eloge/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```

That's it.
