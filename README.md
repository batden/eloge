# eloge

Use this script to uninstall Enlightenment and related applications.

Please take a look at the comments in the script before running it.

## Get started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/eloge.git .eloge
```

This creates a new hidden folder named .eloge in your home directory.

Copy the eloge.sh file from the new .eloge folder to your download folder.

Navigate to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x eloge.sh
```

Then execute the script with:

```bash
./eloge.sh
```

## Update local repo

Change to ~/.eloge/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```
